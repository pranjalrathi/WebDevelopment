            <p>Hey, I'm <strong>Marc</strong> and I work for the next generation of open source developers.</p>
            <p>Tech is reshaping how we learn and come together. Software is ubiquitious and every person can now build their way to a future that inspires them. However,<strong>today's world isn't designed to work for these creators</strong> creating an imbalance between the impact they're capable of, and what's expected of them.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>I'm working to solve this problem…</p>
            <ul>
                <li>by creating better <strong> tools</strong> on <mark> GitHub </mark> for developers and formerly at<mark> Hackerbay</mark> for hackers and companies;</li>
                <li>by building <strong> communities</strong> at <mark>Tea</mark> and formerly as co-founder of<mark> Hackevents</mark> organizing hackathons across Germany, now by mentoring at hackathons around the world;</li>
                <li>by documenting <strong> open source projects </strong> on <mark> YouTube</mark>;
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>...and through one commit at a time.</p>
            <p>Currently, I am working as <strong> Chief Technology Officer </strong>at <mark>AQVC</mark>. It's an amazing place where I get to work alongside great people on our vision to democratize the access to venture capital.</p>
            <p>I'm currently <strong> living in Munich, Germany.</strong> Some other places I've lived in are Helsinki, Berlin, San Francisco, Hong Kong, and Toronto.</p>
            <p>I'm a huge physics nerd, in particular <a href="https//www.google.com">Interesting</a> cosmology. I wrote about the accelerating expansion of the universe, or better know as Dark Energy.</p>

        <h1>Previously</h1>
        <p>I founded and built <mark> Hackerbay</mark> as CTO with three awesome friends. We took a small insight from hackathons – <em> software is not a 12 month development cycle </em>– and built up a B2B company. We worked with Twitter, Vodafone, Allianz and some of Germany's largest corporations. With <mark>NFX</mark> we had incredible investors on board and always an open ear from James, Pete, or Gigi.</p>
        <p>After five years of immense personal and professional growth, priorities changed and we decided to pursue new opportunities, where each of our personal strengths are best put to use.</p>
        <p>For me that's <strong>building tools to improve the economics of open source.</strong></p>

        <h1>Let's connnect</h1>
        <p>I'm most active on <mark>Twitter</mark> and <mark>GitHub</mark> but you can also find me on <mark>LinkedIn.</mark> The best way to contact me is either through Twitter, or my email at my first name @ mfts.io – my DMs and inbox are always open.</p>
